### Some changes are applied to the original library by 'Geir Istad' ###
### The changes aim to enhance the results of *roll-pitch-yaw* and *linear acceleration* ###
### Some changes are made for the ease of use ###
### You need to install 'Scipy library' which is used in 'DMP_get_roll_pitch_yaw' function. The former function was not accurate and was giving improper results ###

### For example, 0x04 gives (200Hz / (1 + 4)) = 40HZ
### I propose 0x04 for a less noisy quaternion and 0x01 for accelerometer & gyrometer.

        ### About transformations ###
        # We have a 16 bit signed number for accelerometer. Thus the range of this number is [-2^15, +2^15]
        # The range of the accelerometer is [-2g, +2g].
        # The ranges are adjustable for accelerometer and gyrometer (in MPU6050 library).

        # You can use RAW or DMP acceleration.
